About
=======

TopSearch is an Python package for mapping the topography of surfaces. The package is
developed within IBM Research UK, and made available under the MIT license. The package
implements methods of the energy landscape framework, with many additions that allow application
to machine learning models, and makes topographical analysis of surface straightforward. We are
continually expanding the functionality and the number of machine learning models that can
be explored using this package.
