# Reconverge molecular landscape

In this example we show how to reconverge a landscape of stationary points in a new potential. We first load the minima and transition states
on the potential energy surface of ethanol computed using a low level of density functional theory. Then we generate the landscape for a higher
level of density functional theory by reconverging the existing stationary points within the new potential. We are able to produce the landscape
at the higher level of theory quickly, and we visualise the difference between the two landscapes.
