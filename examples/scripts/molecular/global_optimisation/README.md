# Molecular structure optimisation

In this script we explore the potential energy surface of a small molecule computed using density functional theory. We optimise the molecular
structure using basin-hopping to locate the global minimum conformation of ethanol. The conformational space is explored by applying random rotations
to the flexible dihedrals, and we easily locate the global minimum for this simple optimisation task. We finally visualise the global minimum.
