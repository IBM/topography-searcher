# Molecular landscape generation

In this script we produce the energy landscape for a small molecule using density functional theory. We explore the potential energy surface
to locate the local minima and the transition states between them. We visualise the structure of the potential energy surface and 
the corresponding conformations at each stationary point. Lasly, we highlight how thermodynamic and kinetic properties of a molecular system
can be derived from these stationary points.
