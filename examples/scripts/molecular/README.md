# Molecular landscapes

A set of Python scripts that illustrate the use of TopSearch in exploring the potential energy surfaces of molecular systems.

* `global_optimisation` - Locate the global minimum conformation of a small molecule using DFT to compute the potential energy
* `generate_landscape` - Generate the complete landscape of minima and transition states for a small molecule
* `reconverge_landscape` - Take the landscape of a small molecule computed at a low level of DFT theory, and reconverge all the minima to get the landscape at a higher level of theory
