# Example scripts

This folder contains a set of scripts that illustrate the different ways in which the TopSearch package can be used to map the topography of arbitrary functions, and how that can be used to improve ML model performance and understanding.

* `atomic` - Example using this code to explore and map the potential energy surface of a small atomic cluster.

* `dataset_roughness` - Examples showing how to use the TopSearch package to estimate the roughness of datasets. The scripts calculate the roughness of molecular, or custom, datasets using topographical analysis and show how this can be relating to model error, allowing us to estimate the appropriateness of a set of features.

* `example_function` - Examples showing the use of TopSearch in mapping the topography of any surface, with examples here for simple test functions that allow for direct visualisation. The scripts cover many of the key features of the TopSearch package and this is the place to start for newcomers.

* `molecular` - Examples using TopSearch to explore the potential energy surfaces of molecular systems. The scripts show how to find the global minimum of a molecular system, map the important regions of configuration space and the transition between them.
