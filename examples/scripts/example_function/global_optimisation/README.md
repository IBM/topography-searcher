# Global optimisation

It is easy to perform global optimisation using TopSearch, and we optimise the Schwefel function in three dimensions in this example. Global optimisation is performed using the basin-hopping algorithm. Basin-hopping explores the solution space locating various local minima, and all other unique minima are stored in addition to the global minimum. Locating all the local minima, including the global minimum, is the first step towards landscape generation.
