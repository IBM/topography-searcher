# Example function scripts

The scripts are separated into:
* `global_optimisation` - Perform global optimisation on a surface to locate its low-valued minima
* `multiprocessing_landscape` - Compare the performance of parallel and serial landscape generation
* `restart_landscape` - Restart a partially-finished landscape calculation
* `simple_landscape` - Compute the landscape of the Schwefel function in two dimensions
