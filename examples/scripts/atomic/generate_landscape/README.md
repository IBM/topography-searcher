# Generate Lennard Jones landscape

In this example we compute the landscape of a simple Lennard Jones cluster composed of 7 atoms. The potential energy surface is 22-dimensional
and cannot be directly visualised. Here, we explore this potential energy surface to locate the unique minima and transition states for this atomic
cluster. The minima and transition states are unique with respect to permutation, rotation, translation and inversion. We visualise the organisation
of this potential energy surface using a disconnectivity graph, which can be applied for any dimensionality.
