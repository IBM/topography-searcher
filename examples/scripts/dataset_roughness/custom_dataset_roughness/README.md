# Custom dataset roughness

In this example we illustrate how TopSearch can be used to estimate the roughness of datasets. Using the energy landscape framework we compute
the [frustration metric](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-0zx26) which quantifies the roughness of the specified dataset. The frustration metric correlates strongly with the model error
when fitting a regression model. Therefore, computation of dataset roughness via the frustration metric is an important measure to understand the
performance of machine learning methods on dataset predictions.
