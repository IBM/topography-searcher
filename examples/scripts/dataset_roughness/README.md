# Dataset roughness

A set of Python scripts that illustrate the use of TopSearch in determining the roughness of 

* `custom_dataset_roughness` - Compute the roughness of a simple dataset using the frustration metric
* `roughness_vs_model_error` - Compute the frustration metric and correlate with model error for several chemical datasets
* `latent_space_roughness` - Compute a continuous roughness surface of an autoencoder's latent space and use it to generate new training data
