# Landescape exploration


We now proceed to generate and explore the landscape of the latent space. We follow the approach used for roughness analysis of a dataset, using a radial basis function interpolation of the molecular similarity values to give a continuous response function. In this case, we generate the landscape in all of the latent space dimensions. 

This is a computationally expesnive process and will take in excessive of 24 hours to run on 64 CPUs.
