# Roughness vs model error

In this example we show how the roughness of multiple datasets can be captured using the frustration metric, and the correlation
of this metric with the neural network model error of the same datasets. We load a series of datasets and perform topographical
analysis to get the frustration metric for each. We then fit a simple neural network to the same datasets and present the
linear correlation between model error and frustration metric to show that we can capture the appropriateness of a set of features
without even fitting a machine learning model.
