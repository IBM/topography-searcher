# Batch BayesOpt example

In this script, we perform batch Bayesian optimisation using the TopSearch package. Batch Bayesian optimisation selects several sample points, rather than one, to evaluate simultaneously at each epoch. The selection of an appropriate batch is a challenge, as it should balance the quality of the points (as measured by the acquisition value) and the diversity (which is harder to quantify). In this example we use a topographical batch selection scheme made possible by the network encoding of the surface structure. We compute the topography at each epoch and the diversity is captured using the intermediate barriers between minima within the space. We use this scheme to optimise the six-hump Camel function using four evaluations points per BayesOpt epoch.
