# Serial BayesOpt

In this script, we run serial Bayesian optimisation using TopSearch. At each epoch we compute the Gaussian process fit and the subsequent upper confidence bound acquisition function. The underlying function we try to optimise is the six-hump Camel function, and the initial dataset is generated by random sampling of this function. For each of these epochs we compute the topography of the upper confidence bound surface, and store the topography as a network of minima and transition states. This network can be used to make decisions about the next sample points to choose in Bayesian optimisation, and their importance. Here, we perform serial BayesOpt, selecting only a single sample point at each epoch, and that point is the global minimum of the acquisition function surface. However, the networks are stored and visualised as disconnectivity graphs at each epoch.
