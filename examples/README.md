# Examples

Contained in this folder are a set of examples that illustrate how to use the TopSearch package to map the topography of high-dimensional surfaces. The examples cover the use on a simple test function, Bayesian optimisation acquisition functions and molecular datasets. We repeat the same examples as both Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for ease of use. The Python scripts, for the same content, are additionally subdivided to make them easier to interpret.
