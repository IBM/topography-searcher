    "Locating transition states requires a combination of single-ended and double-ended searches. Double-ended searches take two minima as input and attempt to find the lowest-valued path between them. Single-ended searches start from a single point and follow the eigenvector corresponding to the most negative eigenvalue until they converge to a transition state. These two searches are used in tandem, with an initial double-ended search, following by a single-ended search applied to each local maximum on the path. Here, we use the nudged elastic band as the double-ended search method. NudgedElasticBand contains the methods to produce an initial path and optimise it to minimise its overall value. We specify it using three parameters: force_constant - determines the tightness of the elastic band, this is updated within the computation, image density - this determines how many points the path is composed of (per unit distance), more points means better path (usually) as higher computational cost, max images - allows us to put a cut on the maximum number of images to limit the computational cost."

Therefore, the graph gives a visual illustration of surface topography in two dimensions, highlighting groups of nodes that are close together as those within a smooth part of the surface. The disconnectivity graph is another two-dimensional representation of surface topography that preserves the true barriers between minima."

Therefore, we can use multiprocessing to further accelerate the exploration of the surface by running each separate transition state search on a different process. After an initial generation of the set of minima that should be connected we spread the calculations across n_processes. Usually we would specify this option in NetworkSampling, but here we simply update these values"
